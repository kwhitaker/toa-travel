## MAINTENNANCE IS PAUSED
I'll make small bug fixes, but this project is no longer being actively maintained.

## Tomb Annihilation Travelogue

Generates travel days for the ToA campaign, with some additional rules from
[Kyle Maxwell](https://skaldforge.wordpress.com/2017/10/02/tomb-of-annihilation-hex-crawl-procedure/).

I did this because I'm about to run ToA, and didn't want to bother with rolling
as my group went. Also, I wanted to try [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io).
